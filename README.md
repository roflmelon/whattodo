# WHATTODO APP

Just another generic To-do app, but the real purpose of building this app is to teach myself the following:
- SSR with NEXT.JS
- CRUD Basics
- REST API
- Authentication
- TypeScript

Features for MVP and my todos in no particular order:
- [ ] Need a login
- [ ] Need authentication
- [ ] Need infinite list
- [ ] Need database setup
- [ ] Need CRUD
- [ ] Need UI

Features that are nice to have:
- Make it PWA
- Allow sorting tasks by desired parameter (ie, deadlines, latest, oldest, etc.)
- Dark/Light Mode (Should honestly be a requirement)

Other options for this project:
- Build using GraphQL
- Use something other than React/NEXT.JS

This to-do list is just for me to learn the basics and hopefully it will be an app that I will use on a daily.
The design will be loosely based on the mobile app MinimaList on iOS platform as seen below:
